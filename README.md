## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com)

### What I learned

I got an idea of how to work with JavaScript.

### Continued development

Obviously, I don't know the best practices for working with JavaScript, so that's
something I should look into.
